# Google+ Domains API PHP Sample

### Description

This is simple example to illustrate how to use
[domain-wide delegation](https://developers.google.com/+/domains/authentication/delegation)
with the [Google+ Domains API](https://developers.google.com/+/domains/) in PHP.

This also shows how you can use the Google+ Domains API in combination with the
[Directory API](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/) to list all users
in your domain and perform Google+ related tasks on their behalf.


### Setup

1.  The [Google APIs Client Library for PHP](https://github.com/google/google-api-php-client/)
    is included as submodule in this repository.
    To retrieve it after cloning this repository you need to:

    ```
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    ```

2.  Follow the steps of the [official docs](https://developers.google.com/+/domains/authentication/delegation)
    to enable domain-wide delegation for your domain.

    For this example you will need to authorize the following scopes:

    ```
    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly
    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.me
    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.stream.read
    ```

3.  You also need to authorize API Access for Administrative APIs in `Security / API Reference`
    in your Domain Admin panel to enable the Admin SDK APIs that include the Directory API

4.  Change the values of `CLIENT_ID`, `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`, `KEY_FILE`, `DOMAIN_ADMIN_EMAIL`
    and `DOMAIN` in `index.php` accordingly.
